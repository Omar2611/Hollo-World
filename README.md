# Hollo-World

I am a public accountant graduated from the Catholic University of TÃ¡chira Venezuela and I am learning to program to carry out my administrative and accounting skills at a higher level and to be at the forefront in this changing world.

My interest is to develop administrative work tools that facilitate and simplify the work

In addition to this, I am interested in creating and designing web pages.
